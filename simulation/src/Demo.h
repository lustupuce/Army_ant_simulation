 *	@brief Implementation of the Demo class and the MyContactListener_v2 class.
 *	@details The Demo class gather all the elements of the simulation: the terrain, the robot controller and the robots and implement more abstract simulation methods.
 *	Those methods handle the robot interaction with the terrain and between themselves ie the group behavior.
 *	This is why the robots are only created via the robot controller.
 *	The demo class also synchronized the physics and simulation step.
 *
 *	The MyContactListener_v2 class is used to create a listener on the contact between the physics elements (robots and terrain).
