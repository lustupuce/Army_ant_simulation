 *	@brief Implementation of the Ramp class which inherit from the Terrain class.
 *	@details Class for the Ramp creation including method for the Box2D implementation (Physics) and the SFMLF synchronization (graphics).
 *	The Ramp Terrain is an horizontal descending ramp.
 *	The top ground is located at m_posY from the top of the window/world and the ramp at a distance m_runaway from the left end of the window/world.
 *	The Ramp is described by a height of m_height (and an angle of 90Â°).
